# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Learning Objective [Reference](https://eng-cs.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cis351_Course-Outcomes.pdf)

To introduce the fundamental concept of data structures and to emphasize the importance of data structures in developing and implementing efficient algorithms. In addition, another objective of the course
is to develop effective software engineering practice, emphasizing such principles as decomposition, procedural abstraction, and software reuse.
